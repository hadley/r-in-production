# Reproducibility across environments

- Ensuring reproducibility in different environments (local, cloud, containerized)   
- Provide cross-team conventions around capturing and restoring package sources/versions  
- Dependency mitigation strategies: advice on “right-sizing” package dependencies, i.e. why it doesn’t matter during exploration, and why it mostly doesn’t matter in production (unless you’re not using P3M, which is where you should start)  
- Use the best practices from package development and testing in implementing testing for changing environments
