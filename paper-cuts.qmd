# Cross-platform paper cuts

```{R}
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE
)
```

Before we dive into the biggest challenges of working on another machine, I wanted to quickly cover a bunch of annoying paper cuts. None of these is particularly hard to work around, but they can be confusing the first time you encounter them and they're a nuisance to keep in the back of your head.

These are particularly likely to surprise you when you first move from running R code on your laptop (usually Windows or Mac) to Linux. That might be because you've joined a company that provides a central development environment on Linux or you're deploying production code onto a Linux server.

## Windows vs Mac/Linux

There are a few differences specifically between Windows and Linux that you need to know about. If you're using a Mac you can skip this section.

### Paths

Generally, in Windows, you use `\` to separate directories in a path. This is a pain in R because `\` is also the string escape character so whenever you're typing a path you have to use `\\`. On Linux (and Mac), you use `/` to separate directories and `\` doesn't work. So the easiest way around this is to just get in the habit of using `/`; this works everywhere and is easier to type 😄. Alternatively, you can avoid every typing a directory separator by using a tool like `file.path()`, or even better, `fs::path()`. We highly recommend using the [fs package](https://fs.r-lib.org) for path manipulations as it standardizes every input to use `/` and ensures that your paths never have have multiple `/` or trailing `/`.

Another path issue that crops up is the meaning of `~.` On Windows and Mac this is a shortcut to your home directory, i.e. the directory in which your desktop and documents directories live. On Windows, however, `~` refers to your documents directory. You can again avoid this problem by using fs, which uses the standard meaning of `~`. This shouldn't affect your production code (since it should be self-contained) but it's good to be aware of.

### Line endings

Windows uses `\r\n` (CRLF) as a line-ending character and Linux uses just `\n` (LF). This is generally taken care of for you, with most R functions automatically switching between the two forms as needed[^paper-cuts-1]. If for some reason this becomes a problem, you might try the [brio package](https://brio.r-lib.org).

[^paper-cuts-1]: This is the primary difference between text and binary mode connections in R: when writing to a text mode connection any `\n` is automatically converted to `\r\n` on Windows.

## UTF-8 encoding

One paper cut has been eliminated in recent versions of R (4.2 or greater) or recent versions of Windows (Windows 10 or later): character encoding. Now Windows uses UTF-8 just the same as Mac and Linux. You can learn more about this challenge and how it was overcome on the [R Core blog](https://blog.r-project.org/2022/11/07/issues-while-switching-r-to-utf-8-and-ucrt-on-windows/){.uri}.

## Locales

The **system locale** defines the regional settings that affect how certain types of data are display and processed by R. It includes things like your time zone and your language, which affects how strings are sorted, how upper and lower case work, how dates are displayed and parsed, and how numbers are displayed.

You almost certainly have your laptop set up with your current time zone and whatever regional settings make the most for you. When you run your code on a Linux server, it's likely to be in a default state where the time zone is UTC and the language is English. Although these problems probably won't affect you that much, it's important to know which R functions are likely to give you different results locally and on the server:

-   When you convert a date-time to a string (e.g. by printing it, `format()`ing it, or pass it to `as.character())` it will use the system time zone, which is likely to be UTC on a server. To make the time easier to understand you might want to supply the `tz` that you work in. You can find the name of the timezone that your laptop uses by running `Sys.timezone()` and learn more about timezone names in general in [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html#time-zones).

-   Whenever you `sort()`, `order()`, or `rank()` a character vector, R will use the current locale to determine the sorting order. On Linux server likely to default to C ordering, which orders strings by their underlying numeric representation. This is unlikely to be what you want, even for English, because it sorts upper case and lower case letters far apart. You can instead use `stringr::str_sort()`, `stringr::str_order()`, and `stringr::str_rank()`which all take an explicit locale argument.

-   When you create a new `factor()`, it creates the levels from the sorted unique values. Becausing sorting varies (as above) this means that your factor levels might vary, and because factor levels define the contrasts this means that coefficients of models can differ (but not their predictions). Instead you can explicitly supply the `levels` or use `forcats::fct()` which uses the unique values in the order that they appear.

-   `toupper()` and `tolower()` can vary based on the current locale. For example, Turkish has a dotless i, ı, which is the lower case form of I. Apart from Turkish[^paper-cuts-2], there are relatively few languages that have upper and lower case but you should know about the problem, and the solution: using`stringr::str_to_upper()` and `stringr::str_to_lower()` which take an explicit locale.

-   `strptime()`, which parses dates and times, relies on the current locale for day of week (`%a` / `%A)` and month name (`%b` / `%B`) (e.g. English has Monday and January, but French has lundi and janvier, and Korean has 일요일 and 1월). If you're parsing dates and need to control which language is used, you can use `readr::parse_date()`, `lubridate::ymd()` and friends, or `clock::date_parse()`. All of these functions take an explicit locale argument.

[^paper-cuts-2]: Which did actually cause a real bug in ggplot2!

Finally note the `OutDec` option which determines what character is used for the decimal place:

```{R}
x <- 1.234
x
options(OutDec = ",")
x
```

This doesn't affect parsing, so is less likely to cause problems, but you may need to explicit set it if numbers are not correctly formatted in your ouptut.

## Graphics devices

If you are producing PNG graphics, be aware that the underlying implementation of the `png()` graphics device varies from platform to platform. That means the rendering of your plots is going to be a little different (and generally worse) when rendering them on Linux . Most of the time this is isn't too important but if you really care about the details of your plots it's worth doing better.

Fortunately the solution is easy: use the [ragg](https://ragg.r-lib.org) package. As well as creating identical plots on every platform, it's also faster, provides advanced text rendering (including right-to-left text and emoji), consistently high-quality graphics rendering, and more convenient access to system fonts. How to use it depends on how you're creating plots:

-   If you're manually creating plots, switch from `png()` to `ragg::agg_png()`.

-   For ggplot2, `ggplot2::ggsave()` with a png extension will use ragg if it's installed.

-   For RStudio, follow the advice at <https://ragg.r-lib.org/#use-ragg-in-rstudio>.

-   For knitr, change the default plotting device by including the following code in your setup chunk: `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")`.

-   For Shiny, `plotOutput()` will use use ragg if it's installed.

If you want ggplot2 and Shiny to use ragg in your production environment, you'll need to explicitly add it as a dependency by including `requireNamespace(ragg)` somewhere in your code. That will ensure it gets captured in your manifest and installed in your production environment.
