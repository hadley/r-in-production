# Masiello Metric ;) 

Can we port the Joel Test [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code)  to data science?

WIP:

1. Using version control individually and as a team  
2. Style guide, linting, code review process, managing change  
3. Projects are isolated and reproducible for other team members and in different environments  
4. secure access to your data   
5. what do you do when your upstream data changes, how do you know and how do you respond  
6. Is your processing automated and do you have alerts and informants in place when an issue arises  
7. code does not depend on you to run; protected from the bus factor  
8. code is instrumented for baseline and performance metrics  
9. means to rapid prototype deployments  
10. process to securely deploy to production with no surprises  
11. share outputs securely and snappily  
12. manage change in deployed projects  
13. plan for upkeep and iteration that isnâ€™t 100% of your job  
14. managed dependency graph for content and process for rolling changes
