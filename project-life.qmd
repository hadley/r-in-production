While the focus of this book is on R in production, we also need to lay out some principles for how to organise your work. This chapter is about how to organise your work and how to live the project oriented lifestyle.

There are three basic principles:

* Each project is a directory.
* In Git.
* On GitHub (or similar).

One of the advantages of choosing to live this lifestyle is that you get a bunch of free tools from the usethis package.

```R
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("usethis")
```

## Setup

We recommend that you automatically load usethis in your interactive sessions so that you can access usethis functions with a minimum of fuss. This is done by adding some code to your `.Rprofile` file, and of course usethis has a helper for that: `usethis::use_usethis()`. I highly recommend running that function and following its advice before continuing.

If you use RStudio, we also highly recommend that you run `usethis::use_blank_slate()` to ensure that RStudio never saves or reloads state. This forces you to capture all important information in your code files, ensuring that you never have objects in your global environment that you don't know how to recreate.

## Directory

### Working directory

R has a powerful notion of the working directory. This is where R looks for files that you ask it to load, and where it will put any files that you ask it to save. RStudio shows your current working directory at the top of the console:

Each project is a directory. This directory contains all the files needed to complete the project. All paths inside the project should be relative to that directory.

> Any resident R script is written assuming that it will be run from a fresh R process with working directory set to the project directory. It creates everything it needs, in its own workspace or folder, and it touches nothing it did not create. For example, it does not install additional packages (another pet peeve of mine).
>
> This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work”. I argue that this is the only practical convention that creates reliable, polite behavior across different computers or users and over time. This convention is neither new, nor unique to R.
>
> It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

There is one small challenge when using Rmd, namely that paths in an Rmd are relatively to the location of the `.Rmd`, not the project. If this becomes a problem, you can work around this by using `here::here()`. This function always returns the path to the project directory, so you can use `here::here("data/my-data.csv")` to refer to a file in the project directory, regardless of where you Rmd/qmd lives.

### RStudio projects

Keeping all the files associated with a given project (input data, R scripts, analytical results, and figures) together in one directory is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects. Let’s make a project for you to use while you’re working through the rest of this book. Click File > New Project, then follow the steps shown in Figure 6.3.

`usethis::create_project()`

### Files

1. File names should be machine readable: avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters. Don’t rely on case sensitivity to distinguish files.
1. File names should be human readable: use file names to describe what’s in the file.
1. File names should play well with default ordering: start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.

```
alternative model.R
code for exploratory analysis.r
finalreport.qmd
FinalReport.qmd
fig 1.png
Figure_02.png
model_first_try.R
run-first.r
temp.txt
```

There are a variety of problems here: it’s hard to find which file to run first, file names contain spaces, there are two files with the same name but different capitalization (`finalreport` vs. `FinalReport1`), and some names don’t describe their contents (`run-first` and `temp`).

Here’s a better way of naming and organizing the same set of files:

```
01-load-data.R
02-exploratory-analysis.R
03-model-approach-1.R
04-model-approach-2.R
fig-01.png
fig-02.png
report-2022-03-20.qmd
report-2022-04-02.qmd
report-draft-notes.txt
```

### Subdirectories

No strong feelings yet, except that if you start writing reusable functions they should go in R, and then you can add tests for them in `tests/testthat`.

## Git

What's commited to Git is the source of truth.

In this book, I assume that you're already familiar with the basics of Git. You certainly don't need to be an expert but you should know how to add and commit files, push and pull, and create branches. I also expect you to know the other key skill for using Git: how to Google/LLM for advice when you get yourself stuck in a situation that you've never seen before.

If you haven't used Git before, I'd recommend that you start by reading [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).

Depending on how you work you may or may not be storing data in your Git repo. But often for production jobs you won't be; because the goal is to run the job regularly with changing datasets. But if the data doesn't live in the repo, you need to include code to get it. No manual steps allowed! (At least aspriationally; they're fine to do pragmatically but over time you want to reduce your reliance on manual steps as much as possible so that your process is reproducible and reliable regardless of who's running it.)

## GitHub

You only get a small amount of the value of Git if you use it locally. You get much more value from combining it with a online site like GitHub. Throughout the rest of the book, I'll talk about GitHub exclusively, but there are a number of both professional and open source solutions that provide very similar functionality, including [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), or [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

If you don't have access to any of these inside your organisation, you need to start a campaign to get it. Any of these tools will provide the opportunity to substantially improve collaboration and coordination within your data science team.

We'll talk about GitHub particularly when it comes to working with a team. But we'll also use it a bunch when deploying your own personal production jobs because GitHub Actions are such a great platform for deplying batch jobs.

If you're just starting out in your career GitHub is a great place to build a portfolio of some of the production jobs you've created for your own life.

This is the way you share your code with others: no on a shared network drive and certainly not by attaching it to emails!

### Source of truth

Whenever you have multiple copies of something, you need to carefully think about which think is going to be the "source of truth". In production scenarios, you have at least two copies of the project: one in your development environment and one in your production environment. And if you code is in git there's one more in the central repo. And if you're working with colleagues, they'll each have their own version. I think there's one obvious place that you should consider the source of truth: the code stored in your central git repo.

(Git is a decentralised protocol and it's certainly possible to use it that way. But it's almost always easier to consider one repo as "special" and that's the one that's available on GitHub.)

Whereever possible we recommend using "Git-backed" deployments where the production environment retrieves the code directly from your central Git repo. This means avoiding click-to-deploy for important jobs, because it eliminates one possible copy of the project.
